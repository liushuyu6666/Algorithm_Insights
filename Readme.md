# How to use
Go to the `Types` folder first to find the question type you want to delve into, The `Type` page will always list all questions, algorithms and skills used. When join into a specific algorithm or skill, caveats will be listed.

The order is `Type` -> `Algorithms` / `Skills` / `Language` -> `Caveats`

# Section Introduction

This project is organized into five distinct sections:

1. **Types**:
   - Represents the category of a question.
   - While some question types have a strong correlation with specific algorithms (e.g., dynamic programming), others might fall under the same type but require different skills or algorithms.
   - Questions are grouped by their `Type` label. Relevant algorithm or skill URLs associated with these questions will be provided. Where possible, these URLs should link to the current repository.
   - Note: Some questions might be labeled with multiple `Types`. All such labels should be taken into account.

2. **Algorithms/Skills**:
   - Provides a brief overview of specific algorithms or skills.
   - Directs readers to the associated README file in the respective question's directory for comprehensive details and use cases.
   - If there are caveats or language-specific skills under a certain algorithm or skill, links to the `Caveats` or `Languages` sections will be provided.

3. **Caveats**:
   - Briefly documents various caveats.
   - A link to the specific README file of a question for detailed insights will be provided.

4. **Languages**:
   - Highlights language-specific techniques or skills.
   - Associated URLs will direct readers to detailed discussions in the specific README file of a question.

# Overview
The Grouping algorithm finds application in arrays or strings. By arranging adjacent elements or characters according to specified rules or constraints, we can streamline the array or string, directing our attention to the desired features.
One possible approach to group a string is using regex.

# Examples
## binary string
Consider a binary string, `0110001111.` Utilizing the Grouping algorithm, we can segment it based on the number of the binary characters, resulting in a simplified array: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Subsequent actions can then be effectively performed on this structured representation.

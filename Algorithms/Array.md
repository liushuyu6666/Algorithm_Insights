# Overview
This concerns algorithms and techniques within array data structures.


# Array Mapping
![array mapping](static/array_mapping.png).

This algorithm is applicable in the following scenario:
1. To maintain element consistency.

# Letters Array
We can utilize an array with 26 elements to store the occurrences of a specific letter as it appears in a string. Similarly, an array can be employed to store the count of distinct elements.

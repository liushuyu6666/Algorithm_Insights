# Overview
This concerns algorithms and techniques within array data structures.


# Array Mapping
Typically, an initial integer array is provided, where each element adheres to the pattern `arr[x] = x`. Subsequently, element values undergo manipulation, establishing a distinct correlation or rule between the indices and the values. As a result, the array's indices retain the consistency, while the corresponding values exhibit a transformed relationship.

# String Question
## Characters Occurrences
This type of question only concerns the occurrence of letters, irrespective of the position of each letter. For instance, consider the count of occurrences of the letter 'p' in the word 'pattern'.

## Character mapping
This type of question focuses on both the occurrences of letters and their positions. For example, are 'paper' and 'title' isomorphic?
